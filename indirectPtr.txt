tep 2: Map that logical block number to a physical block on disk
Use this decision tree:

ðŸ”¹ Case 1: Direct block
If block_number < 12:

The data is in one of the 12 direct blocks.

Just use: inode.direct[block_number]

ðŸ”¹ Case 2: Single indirect block
If block_number >= 12 and < 12 + 1024:

Subtract 12 to find index within the single indirect block:

plaintext
Copy code
i = block_number - 12
Load the single indirect block from disk (it contains 1024 pointers).

Use pointer at index i.

ðŸ”¹ Case 3: Double indirect block
If block_number >= 12 + 1024 and < 12 + 1024 + 1024Â²:

Subtract base:

plaintext
Copy code
i = block_number - (12 + 1024)
Compute:

first index: i / 1024 â†’ which second-level pointer to use

second index: i % 1024 â†’ which data block within that

Steps:

Read the double indirect block (1024 pointers)

Use index i / 1024 to find the correct indirect block

Read that indirect block

Use index i % 1024 to find the data block

ðŸ”¹ Case 4: Triple indirect block
If block_number >= 12 + 1024 + 1024Â²:

Similar logic, but now you need 3 levels:

plaintext
Copy code
i = block_number - (12 + 1024 + 1024Â²)
level1 = i / (1024 Ã— 1024)
level2 = (i / 1024) % 1024
level3 = i % 1024
Steps:

Read triple indirect block â†’ gives 1024 pointers to double indirect blocks

Use level1 to pick which double indirect block

Read that â†’ gives 1024 pointers to single indirect blocks

Use level2 to pick the indirect block

Read that â†’ gives 1024 data block pointers

Use level3 to get the final data block
