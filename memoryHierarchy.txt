Hierchy of stores, we want to use stores higher in the hrcy more often,
e.g. registers are fastest. 
we have many fewer registers.
magnetic tape slowest but cheapest.
the hardware can keep stuff in the cache memory.
cpu cache is fast memory placed between cpu and main memory.
 
effective access time:
T_eff = H * T_1 + (1-H) * T_2.

Moving head mechanism:
read - write head. access time is slow as the head spins and hence more misses.
same as when we are on google, we save some stuff on disk if internet is bad.
